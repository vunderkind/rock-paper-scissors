Reasoning about the Rock Paper Scissors Challenge in Python

 In solving this challenge, I thought about where the computer choices were stored and how I'd like it to be displayed on the screen. 


In this step, I spent a lot of time reading the current code and understanding where the computer choice was stored. I needed to be able to get that information and print it in the function that ran the game itself (`display_result_and_update_scores`). 

I also studied the steps the function that fulfils quit requests took and put in the historical data function at the tail end so that's the last thing the player sees.
